# OPENLC
Open Source mod designed for FiveM using Rockstar Games GTA IV map assets

How to use

- Download script and start/ensure it on your server resources .cfg
- Enjoy.

Known bugs

- Theres some bad prop rotation on interiors due to gta iv props naturally, can be fixed easily with CodeWalker.
- Some chairs and street props need new embed collisions / ytyp static flags. Collisions can be done on 3ds max, flags can be fixed on CodeWalker.
- Theres some wrong portal flags around the map MLOs, they can be fixed also on CodeWalker.
- Maybe theres some bad/invisible textures related to EFLC props, currently we dont know why.

Disclaimer

- Make sure to have a legal copy of GTA IV EFLC, because you will use GTA IV EFLC assets on this mod, we are not responsible for unauthorized uses of Rockstar Games/Take-Two Interactive content.
- We will not give support to this version, it has everything from EFLC, ymaps, models, good water, working subway... and its "ready to go", however we admire the work of the community and we make this public under a GNU license so that people stop selling these assets for money and so that the community can fix the few missing bugs.
- We share this mod for free, its just a lot of public/private versions with scripts/models merged from/for GTA IV/GTA IV EFLC stuff, all the work belongs to Rockstar Games/Take-Two Interactive and the creators of those scripts, we just ported the stuff to GTA 5 on FiveM and modified a bit the structure of some FiveM scripts like PichotM ones.
