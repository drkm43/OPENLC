# OPENLC
Open Source mod designed for FiveM using Rockstar Games GTA IV map assets

How to use

- Download script and start/ensure it on your server resources .cfg
- Enjoy.

Known bugs

- Theres some bad prop rotation on interiors due to gta iv props naturally, can be fixed easily with codewalker.
- Maybe theres some bad/invisible textures related to EFLC props, currently we dont know why.
- Some chairs and street props need new embed collisions / static flags.

Disclaimer

- Make sure to have a legal copy of GTA IV EFLC, because you will use GTA IV EFLC assets on this mod, we are not responsible for unauthorized uses of Rockstar Games/Take Two content.
- We will not give support to this version, it has everything from EFLC, ymaps, models, good water, working subway... and its "ready to go", however we admire the work of the community and we make this public under a GNU license so that people stop selling these assets for money and so that the community can fix the few missing bugs.
- We share this mod for free, its just a lot of public/private versions scripts/models mixed everything from GTA IV/GTA IV EFLC stuff, all the work belongs to Rockstar Games/Take-Two Interactive, we just ported the stuff to GTA 5 on FiveM.
